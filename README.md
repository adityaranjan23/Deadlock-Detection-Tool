# Deadlock-Detection-Tool
######
## 📌 Overview

The **Automated Deadlock Detection Tool** is designed to monitor system processes and resources, detect potential deadlocks, and provide resolution options. It utilizes system calls, process monitoring, and graph-based cycle detection algorithms to analyze deadlock scenarios dynamically.

## 🚀 Features

- **Process & Resource Tracking:** Monitors system resources in real-time.
- **Graph-Based Deadlock Detection:** Uses cycle detection algorithms (DFS, Tarjan’s) for analysis.
- **Deadlock Resolution:** Suggests solutions like terminating processes or reallocating resources.
- **Automated Monitoring:** Runs periodically via cron jobs or system daemons.
- **Visualization & Logging:** Displays deadlock conditions and logs them for future reference.


### Programming Languages

- **Python** - For system monitoring and graph processing.

### Libraries and Tools

- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration.
- **VS code** - Coding environment.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Deadlock Detector

Run the script to start monitoring:

```sh
python src/deadlock_detector.py
```

### Example Output

```
🔍 Monitoring Processes for Deadlocks...
✅ No Deadlock Detected

🔍 Monitoring Processes for Deadlocks...
🔴 Deadlock Detected: [(1234, 'Memory_1024000'), ('Memory_1024000', 5678), (5678, 1234)]
🔴 Killing Process: 1234 to resolve deadlock
✅ Process 1234 Terminated Successfully
```

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Implement GUI for better visualization.
- Support multi-resource allocation tracking.
- Use machine learning to predict deadlocks.
